## **Traditional NLP Techniques**  
- **Counting Tokens:** Tokenizing text and counting tokens for preprocessing tasks.  
- **Bag-of-Words & TF-IDF:** Creating document-term matrices and extracting meaningful features from text.  

---

## **Word Embeddings**  
- **Word2Vec:** Generating dense vector representations that capture word semantics and relationships.  

---

## **Advanced Architectures**  
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Sequence modeling for tasks like text generation and sentiment analysis.  
- **Autoencoders:** Compressing and reconstructing text data for unsupervised learning applications.  
- **Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence):** Building models for tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and more.  
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** Fine-tuning state-of-the-art models for advanced NLP applications.
